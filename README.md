A small project I wrote for learning about sockets and networking in various languages.

The idea is to implement the same functionality in different languages to learn a bit about how sockets are handled.

Most of the versions are stuck in limbo while I focus on other things, but the Lisp server is mostly functional, followed by the C and C++ servers.

All language versions come with a makefile, so running 'make' in the directory after checking out a branch should build the executables.
